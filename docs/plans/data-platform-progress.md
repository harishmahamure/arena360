## Completed through API-0027

- 23 planned tasks completed.
- PostgreSQL control plane with tenant registry, global staff identities, memberships,
  subscriptions, licences, and signed entitlement caching.
- Tenant-aware staff, device, and player authentication.
- Ownership leases with renewal, self-fencing, reassignment protection, and explicit handoff.
- Tenant routing cache and HTTP, SSE, and WebSocket proxying.
- Per-tenant SQLite baseline with strict storage conventions and transactional outbox.
- Lease-gated `TenantDb` handles with one writer, bounded readers, WAL mode, retries, and idle
  reaping.
- Resumable, concurrency-limited tenant migration orchestration.
- Resumable tenant provisioning with canonical units, access roles, and setting overrides.
- Exact scale-4 money and fixed-width UTC timestamp helpers with property tests.
- Transactional tenant outbox writer with atomic commit/rollback coverage.
- Strict tenant-local core venue schema for catalog, pricing, devices, identities, wallets,
  sessions, transactions, credit, kiosk checkout, recipes, and checkout stock.
- Lease-fenced tenant SQLite catalog and pricing repositories with transactional outbox events,
  location-scoped authorization, scheduled policy activation, and tenant-aware configuration
  snapshots.
- Tenant SQLite device, player-plan, wallet, and session repositories with atomic dynamic
  deduction, ledger/outbox writes, idempotent retries, and staged realtime compatibility.
- Tenant SQLite transaction, credit, kiosk-order, and checkout repositories with atomic stock
  deduction, immutable sale snapshots, exact payment reconciliation, idempotent plan grants,
  historical credit settlements, and transactional outbox events.

## Current task

- [ ] `API-0028` — Port players and the staff membership projection used by tenant APIs.

## M4 queue

- [x] `DB-0010b` — Core venue SQLite schema.
- [x] `API-0024` — Catalog and pricing repositories.
- [x] `API-0026` — Devices, sessions, and wallets.
- [x] `API-0027` — Transactions, ledger, credit, kiosk orders, and checkout stock deduction.
- [ ] `API-0028` — Players and staff membership projection.
- [ ] `API-0032` — In-process realtime dispatch.

## Accepted architecture decisions

- `ADR-0043` — Storage Cells with per-tenant SQLite and DuckDB.
- `ADR-0044` — Tenant SQLite baseline and outbox schema.
- `ADR-0045` — Tenant provisioning bootstrap schema and defaults.
- `ADR-0046` — Core venue SQLite schema.

## Verification

- Full backend test suite passes.
- Tenant venue, catalog, commerce, schema, provisioning, migration, and lease regression tests pass.
- Latest completed implementation commit: `44b5a00` (`API-0027`).

## Update rule

After each task:

1. Update the source build plan checkbox and completion note.
2. Update this file's date, current task, milestone checklist, and verification status.
3. Record the implementation commit.
